## React Notes from udemy

### React Basics

- Component spliting is importanat. when there are much element or code in a single <br>
  component just split it to other part
- About State: - To change the value of rendered element we can use state <br>
  i.e ExpenseForm.js, App.js - To change the state-value depending apon previous state we need to use <br>
  function as an argument in state-changing-function <br>
  i.e App.js <br>
  i.e const [stateVariable, setStateVariable ] = useState('Inittial value') <br>
  setStateVariable( argue => {<br>
  ...argue,<br>
  extraArgu: some-more-data<br>
  }) - **Note:** When state funciton runs it reloads componet(JSX) function
  <br>
- To tranfer a values from one component to other component we use props to pass <br>function pointer to children component and then we call the function in children <br> component and pass an data as an arguments. so that data/argument can be used in <br>parent component to do whatever we want.<br>
  i.e NewExpense.js -> saveExpenseFormHandler
  <br>

- To map a list of item we use {items.map( item => { create an element here })} <br>
- When we map a list of item we need to specify a unique-key to each item to identify <br> each item in a unique way. it is for react not for us..<br>
  i.e ExpenseList.js
  <br>

- JSX code can be written out of return as in Expense.js <br>
- When we need to load components data on condition use conditional loading method<br>
  i.e NewExpense.js, Expense.js <br>
- JSX can also do dynamic style<br>
  i.e CharBar.js <br>
- when code does not give expected output then first see the terminal to see fix <br>the errors.

### CSS dynamic styling

- CSS: if no space between two classes in css then it means both is applied to same <br>element i.e CourseInput.css <br>
- template literals also works in same as javaScipt i.e CourseInput.js <br>
- Styled Componenet is package to style perticular component, insted of styling to all the <br>components. To install it in project file -> npm install --save sytyled-components <br>
- special javaScirpt method is used as styled.button``. It is javaScript method not <br>styled-component method. i.e Button.js<br>
- There can be two component in one file, one for jsx and second for styled component <br> i.e CourseInput.js <br>
- Media Query can be added directly to styled components. i.e Button.js <br>
- CSS module is used to give unique classname to elements and separate our JSX component <br>and CSS files. These is preferd way to do it. <br>
- We can call CSS selector in two different way in CSS modules <br>
  - styles.<name-of-selector> <br>
  - styles['<name-of-selector>'] <br>
- Media Query in CSS module is same as normal CSS. i.e Button.module.css <br>

### Error Understading and debugging

- For good deveoper we need to **find and debug** errors by own.
- Don't Panic
  - Read the error mesaage
  - See the file from which it comes
  - And go to that file and line
- Use consol to see the errors and waring.
- Use browser developer to bebug the code using tag/pointer to debug step buy step.
- React developement tool is really usefull to analysing and debugging the code.

### Fragments, Portal and wraps

- wrapper is used to avoid unwanted nested div. It does not render anthing <br>but only used to trick to follow a rule of only one main element in JSX <br>i.e MyForm.js in PracticeProject
- Fragments
  - Used to avoid unnecessry div elements.
  - Two method
    - <> ...</>
    - <React.Fragment>....</React.Fragment>
    - i.e App.js on practice project
- Portals
  - To allow Custom JSX to place where it shold be
  - To work with portals we need to add extra div to pulic > index.html
    - i.e public > index.html in PracticeProject
  - And to use that see ErrorModal.js
    - i.e {ReactDOM.createPortal( <br>
      <Backdrop onConfirm={props.onConfirm} />, <br>
      document.getElementById("backdrop-root") <br>
      )}
- Refs
  - They allow to access DOM elements.
  - With Refs we set up a connection between a HTML elements(JSX) and other <br>javaScript code
  - ref can be pass to any html element
  - it gives object which hold the current properties of element connected<br> with
  - So ref is dom object, we can manipulate as per need. but do this <br>**rarely, very rarely** if needed
  - i.e MyForm.js in PracticeProject

- Note: Form field like input is tagged with
  - Ref then it is **uncontrolled component**.
    - beacase we do not controll the input field by React
    - instead we just read the value
  - State then it is **controlled components** - becase we control the state of input by passing value

### Side Effect, Reducers, Context

- Effect/Side Effect

  - Side Effects can be like
    - Sending HTTP Request
    - Manage Timers
    - Send data to browser storage
  - So it is always placed outside of React functions
  - so we have useEffect() Hook
    - it runs when first time componenet loads then
    - it runs(executes firstargue) when dependecies(second argue) changes
  - It basically avoids infinite looping.
  - **Important Note:** Use Case of useEffect()
    - When we want to run a state-update-function without any event like <br>onchange, onclick, etc. Means we want to run state-update-function<br>directly inside react component function, at that time we need to<br>use useEffect() to avoid infinite looping
      <br>i.e App.js and Login.js in LoginAndLogout project
  - Dependencies can be defined by function parameters used in useEffect <br>function. i.e Login.js in LoginAndLogout project
  - **About Debouncing:** Use case:
    - We want to run a useeffct function in email and password change but after waiting to 500ms from last key press.
    - This can increase performance of code by not requestin on every key press
    - i.e Login.js in LoginAndLogout

- Reducer/useReducer() for state management

  - used for more complex states managements
  - can be used as replacement of useState. But only if needed
  - used when state-updates depends on other states. But that should not <br>be done directly using sate-update. Beacause it produces bug/error <br>somtimes. even we can't use function in state-update because it is <br>available only for preState of it self, not of other state. This is use case fo **useRecucer** where state-update depends on other states.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  - Reducer Example<br>
    const emailReducer = (state, action) => { <br>
        if (action.type === "USER_INPUT") { <br>
        return { value: action.val, isValid: action.val.includes("@") }; <br>
        } <br>
        if (action.type === "INPUT_BLUR") { <br>
        return { value: state.value, isValid: state.value.includes("@") }; <br>
        } <br>
        return { value: "", isValid: false }; <br>
        }; <br>
    const [emailState, dispatchEmail] = useReducer(emailReducer, {
        <br>value: "",
        <br>isValid: null,<br>
        });
    - Diving to parameters
      - emailState -> holds the current state values/variables
      - dispathEmail -> executes a emailReducer funnction and argus
        are passed as 'action' in emailReducer
      - emailReducer -> returns the updated state/object to be stored
        in emailState. 'state' argue in emailReducer holds the previous-state snapshot

        Adding Nested Properties As Dependencies To useEffect

- when useState and useReducer
    - useState is used when
        - the main sate management "tools"
        - Great for independent pieace of state/data
        - Great if state updates are easy and limited to a few kinds of upates
    - UseReducer is used when
        - Great if you need "more power"
        - Should be considered if youo have related pieces fo state.data
        Can be helpful if you have more complex state upadtes
    - **Note:** There is no hardcore rule for this. it just a reference

- Context
    - In some cases to forward a props without needing it but just passed/forwarded to following compenents. 
    -  In above case we neeed **context** without using a prop chain 
    - i.e navigation.js in LoginAndLogout project
    - Limtations:
        - "props" for cofiguration and "context" for state-managemant across <br>components
        - React "context" can not be used for high frequency changes!

- forwardRef
  - When ref assign to component forwardRef is used to pass that ref to one of children. This is specially needed for reusable component library like button, input, card etc..
  - Used w`hen we want to expose/forward a data, like function, value or anything that we want, to parent component and we can use that with ref and trigger some fucntionality
  - this is not preferable at any cost
  - avoid using this and find some alternative solution
  - Focusing and input is very realistic use case for forwardRef
  - i.e Input.js in LoginAndLogout project
