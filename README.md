## React Notes from udemy
- Complonent spliting is importanat. when there are much element or code in a single <br>
component just split it to other part
- To change the value of rendered element we need to use state <br>
i.e ExpenseForm.js, App.js
- To change the state-value depending apon previous state we need to use <br>
    function as an argument in state-changing-function <br> 
    i.e App.js <br>
    i.e const [stateVariable, setStateVariable ] = useState('Inittial value') <br>
        setStateVariable( argue => {<br>
            ...argue,<br>
            extraArgu: some-more-data<br>
        })<br>
<br>
- To tranfer a values from one component to other component we use props
- To transfer a data to upword side means from child to parent we use props to pass <br>function pointer to children component and then we call the function in children <br> component and pass an data as an arguments. so that data/argument can be used in <br>parent component to do whatever we want.<br>
i.e NewExpense.js -> saveExpenseFormHandler
<br>

- To map a list of item we use {items.map( item => { create an element here })}
- When we map a list of item  we need to specify a unique-key to each item to identify <br> each item in a unique way. it is for react not for us..<br>
i.e ExpenseList.js 
<br>

- JSX code can be written out of return as in Expense.js 
- When we need to load components data on condition use conditional loading method<br>
i.e NewExpense.js, Expense.js
- JSX can also do dynamic style<br>
i.e CharBar.js
- when code does not give expected output then first see the terminal to see fix <br>the errors.
- CSS: if no space between two classes in css then it means both is applied to same <br>element i.e CourseInput.css
